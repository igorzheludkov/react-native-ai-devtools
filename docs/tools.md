# Available Tools

Reference for the MCP tools provided by React Native AI DevTools. For the exact tool list your installed version exposes, ask the agent — the server advertises them on connection.

## Usage Guide

| Tool              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_usage_guide` | Get recommended workflows for all tools. Call without params for overview, with a topic (`setup`, `inspect`, `layout`, `interact`, `logs`, `network`, `state`, `bundle`) for the full guide |

The server also sends instructions on connection, so MCP clients automatically learn about `get_usage_guide`.

## Connection & Logs

| Tool                    | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scan_metro`            | Scan for Metro servers and auto-connect. **Called automatically by the agent** at session start — no need to invoke manually |
| `connect_metro`         | Connect to a specific Metro port. **Usually called automatically** — use manually only when you need a non-standard port     |
| `disconnect_metro`      | Disconnect from all Metro servers. Frees the CDP slot for the built-in RN debugger. Reconnect with `scan_metro`              |
| `get_apps`              | List connected apps. Run `scan_metro` first if none connected                                                                |
| `get_connection_status` | Get detailed connection health, uptime, and recent disconnects                                                               |
| `ensure_connection`     | Verify/establish connection with health checks                                                                               |
| `get_logs`              | Retrieve console logs (filtering, truncation, summary)                                                                       |
| `search_logs`           | Search logs for specific text (truncation)                                                                                   |
| `clear_logs`            | Clear the log buffer                                                                                                         |

## Network Tracking

| Tool                   | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_network_requests` | Retrieve network requests (filtering, summary)                |
| `search_network`       | Search requests by URL pattern                                |
| `get_request_details`  | One request's headers, body, timing. Body comes back as its shape; `query="dotted.path"` returns a field in full and renders only that side, `include` overrides. Credentials render as `[secret:<handle>]` — no argument lifts that, `verbose` included |
| `clear_network`        | Clear the network request buffer                              |
| `network_mock`         | Replace or tamper with responses (add / list / remove / clear) |
| `network_condition`    | Simulate offline / slow / normal network                      |
| `network_replay`       | Re-issue a captured request, with optional overrides          |
| `http_request`         | Issue a request from the host rather than through the app, carrying a vaulted credential by `auth: { secret }`. Placement defaults to `Authorization: Bearer`; `header` sends a key header (`X-API-Key`) and `scheme` another scheme (`Basic`, or `""` for a bare value). No app TLS trust, proxy or cookie jar, and mock rules do not intercept it — so a difference against `app_request` separates a server bug from a client one. Cookie-authenticated sessions cannot be sent from here: use `app_request` |
| `list_secrets`         | The credentials captured this session, by handle, with origin, age and JWT expiry. Values are never shown. Memory-only |
| `vault_capture`        | Read a credential out of the running app into the vault without returning it — for a cold session, a background-refreshed token, or one held in a keychain |

## App Inspection & Execution

| Tool                 | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `execute_in_app`     | Run a JS expression in the app. `state`/`store`, `apollo`/`cache()`/`deref()`, `router`, `summary()` and `require()` are pre-resolved in scope; oversized results are bounded structurally. `timeoutMs` sizes the promise poll ladder; a promise that outlives it returns a handle to collect with `collect`/`waitMs` |
| `app_request`        | Issue an HTTP request from inside the app as the logged-in user. `auth="auto"` resolves the bearer token in-app, so no credential enters the transcript |
| `list_debug_globals` | Discover available debug objects (Apollo, Redux, Expo Router, etc.)                         |
| `inspect_global`     | Inspect a global object to see its properties and callable methods                          |
| `reload_app`         | Reload the app (auto-connects if needed, and reconnects afterwards - the reply says so when the fresh runtime is still booting). Use sparingly - Fast Refresh handles most changes |

> **Tip:** Install the [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/execbro-sdk) — optional, but recommended: full network capture from app startup (including request/response bodies), enhanced log collection, and direct agent control over navigation, state stores, and any custom reference you pass in.

## Layout & Component Inspection

| Tool                       | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_screen_state`         | Screenshot-free orientation snapshot — active route + navigation stack, overlays, and every on-screen pressable, text, and image with a tap-ready `(x, y)`. Switches and checkboxes carry their value as `[switch:ON]`/`[switch:OFF]`. Use `pressablesOnly=true` for just the tappable list |
| `get_screen_layout`        | Screen map of visible components with positions, sizes, and text content. Use `extended=true` for layout styles |
| `get_component_tree`       | React fiber tree. Compact names-only by default; pass `structureOnly=false` for the full detailed tree          |
| `find_components`          | Find components by name pattern. Use `includeLayout=true` for styles                                            |
| `inspect_component`        | Inspect a component's props, state (hooks), and children                                                        |
| `inspect_at_point`         | Per-ancestor frames + props + style + `source: {file, line, column}` at (x, y) — pure JS, no overlay flicker    |
| `get_images`               | Access shared image buffer (screenshots, tap verification frames)                                               |

All of these tools — plus the screenshot summaries and `tap` — speak one screen-space coordinate system. A coordinate from any of them can be passed to any other unchanged, with no conversion.

On a screen presented as a modal sheet (`presentation:'modal'`), UIKit insets it from the top of the window and React Native's own measurements do not include that inset. Every one of these tools corrects for it, derived from the sheet's measured height rather than assumed, so they keep agreeing with each other and with a screenshot; `get_screen_state` names the correction when it applies.

See [Layout & Component Inspection guide](layout-inspection.md) for detailed workflows.

## Bundle Tools

| Tool                  | Description                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `get_bundle_status`   | Get Metro bundler status and build state   |
| `get_bundle_errors`   | Get compilation errors with file locations. `clear=true` also resets the buffer |

## UI Interaction (Cross-Platform)

| Tool                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `navigate`   | Navigate the router directly and verify the route actually changed. Expo Router takes paths, React Navigation takes route names; unknown names are rejected before dispatch with nearest-match suggestions |
| `tap`                         | **Unified tap** — auto-detects platform, tries fiber tree → accessibility → OCR → coordinates. Accepts text, testID, component name, or coordinates from any layout tool or screenshot summary. Returns a post-tap screenshot by default and verifies visual change via before/after diff, with `verification.regions` locating where the screen changed (screenshot pixels — feed a centre straight into `inspect_at_point`). Use `native=true` for coordinate taps without React Native connection (system dialogs, non-RN apps). Use `duration` (ms) to long press — held touch for context menus, drag starts and multi-select, reported back with `longPress.handlerFound`. Switches and checkboxes resolve by `testID`/`component` despite having no `onPress`, and the response carries `switch.before/after/changed` read back from the element. Use `device` (substring match) or `udid` (iOS, exact) to pin to a specific device when multiple are connected |
| `input_text`                  | **Unified text entry** — target a field with `testID`/`component`/`textMatch` (focuses itself, no prior tap needed) and it writes through React, reading the result back and comparing exactly. `replace:true` clears the field first instead of appending. Use `native=true` to type into whatever the OS reports as focused with no RN targeting at all — system dialogs, non-RN screens; auto-applied when no fiber tree is reachable even without the flag. The comparison forgives what the field itself did (`autoCapitalize`, autocorrect respacing, a display mask) and names a `maxLength` truncation rather than retrying it; a masked `secureTextEntry` field is reported as delivered but unverifiable, since the accessibility tree only ever exposes bullets. |
| `swipe`                       | **Unified swipe** — auto-detects platform (iOS/Android), dispatches to the native driver, and returns a `verification` block. `verification.meaningful` is false when the swipe produced no visual change, and `warning` then names which one it was — end-of-list, non-scrollable surface, wrong axis, missed coordinates, or (with no React Native connection) that the screen could not be inspected at all. Set `burst:true` to surface transient overscroll/bounce feedback. Set `verify:false, screenshot:false` for the fastest path. |
| `pinch`                       | **Real two-finger pinch-to-zoom — ANDROID EMULATOR ONLY (iOS in progress).** Sends two genuine kernel touch contacts through the emulator's multi-touch bridge, so it drives any surface on screen (React Native, native views, WebViews, maps), not just RN. `direction:"out"` zooms in, `"in"` zooms out; `x`/`y` set the focal point in the shared screenshot-pixel space; `scale` is the finger-separation ratio and chains into multiple gestures when too large for one; `angle` picks the finger axis. `span` is the fraction of the screen the gesture occupies — 1 by default for `"out"`, 0.5 for `"in"` (a pinch-in starts with the fingers far apart, so a full span lands them on a top bar or bottom sheet). Lower it further if a gesture still lands on surrounding UI. Returns `verification.meaningful` like `swipe`. Physical Android devices and iOS return an explicit error rather than a partial result |

**Examples:**

```
tap with text="Submit"                    # Finds and taps by visible text
tap with testID="login-btn"               # Finds by testID prop
tap with component="HamburgerIcon"        # Finds by React component name
tap with x=300 y=600                      # Taps at coordinates from any layout tool or screenshot
tap with text="Menu" strategy="ocr"       # Forces OCR strategy only
tap with x=300 y=600 native=true          # Taps directly via ADB/simctl (no RN connection needed)
tap with testID="row-3" duration=800      # Long press — holds the touch (RN's onLongPress fires at 500ms)
swipe with startX=200 startY=600 endX=200 endY=200            # Scroll up; reads verification.meaningful
swipe with startX=200 startY=600 endX=200 endY=200 burst=true # Catches overscroll/bounce feedback
```
