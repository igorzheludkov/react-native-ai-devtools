# Layout & Component Inspection

> **Preview:** This guide is a work in progress. Tool descriptions and workflows may change as the feature set evolves.

Tools for understanding the structure and layout of your React Native screens. Use these to identify components, inspect their props and styles, and debug layout issues.

## Overview

| Tool                       | Purpose                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `get_screen_state`         | Screenshot-free orientation snapshot — active route, overlays, and every on-screen element with a tap-ready centre |
| `get_screen_layout`        | Screen map of visible components with positions, sizes, and text content             |
| `get_component_tree`       | React fiber tree (providers, navigation, internals). Compact names-only by default    |
| `find_components`          | Search for components by name pattern across the entire tree                         |
| `inspect_component`        | Deep dive into a specific component's props, state, and hooks                        |
| `inspect_at_point`         | Per-ancestor frames + props + style + source file:line at (x, y) — pure JS, no flicker |
| `get_images`               | Access the shared image buffer (screenshots from all tools, tap verification frames) |

## Coordinates

All of these tools speak one screen-space coordinate system — `get_screen_state`, `get_screen_layout`, `measure`, `inspect_at_point`, the screenshot summaries, and `tap`. Take a coordinate from any one of them and pass it to any other unchanged. There is no conversion step.

## get_screen_state

Screenshot-free snapshot of the current screen. Returns the active route and its params, the navigation stack, any open overlays, and every on-screen element merged top-to-bottom — pressables (component tag, label, testID, `onPress` hint), text, and images — each with a tap-ready `(x, y)` centre and its frame. Elements sitting behind an open overlay or a raised keyboard are grouped separately, so you can see at a glance which ones a tap will not reach.

```
get_screen_state
```

**Key parameters:**

- `pressablesOnly=true` — return just the tappable elements
- `fullText=true` — disable text truncation

Call this after any tap or navigation to confirm where you landed before reaching for a screenshot.

## get_screen_layout

Returns visible components as an indented tree with actual screen positions. Uses `measureInWindow` for real coordinates and filters out off-screen components. This is the best starting point for understanding what's on screen.

```
get_screen_layout
```

Returns meaningful component names with text content and frame data (`x, y width x height`). Coordinates are in the shared screen space used by every layout tool — see [Coordinates](#coordinates).

**Key parameters:**

- `extended=true` — include layout styles (padding, margin, flex, backgroundColor)
Host components (View, Text) are always filtered out — the tree is custom components only, so there is no switch for it.

**Tip:** Use `tap(text=...)` or `tap(testID=...)` to interact with components discovered in the layout.

## get_component_tree

Returns the full React fiber hierarchy — includes providers, navigation wrappers, context components, and everything rendered in the tree.

```
get_component_tree
```

**Key parameters:**

- `structureOnly=true` — compact names-only output, much smaller response
- `focusedOnly=true` — limit to the focused screen (useful in navigation-heavy apps)

Use this when you need the complete picture. For a screen overview with positions and text, prefer `get_screen_layout`.

## find_components

Search for components matching a name pattern across the entire fiber tree.

```
find_components with pattern="Card"
```

**Key parameters:**

- `includeLayout=true` — include padding, margin, flex styles for each match

**Workflow:** Use after `get_screen_layout` or `get_component_tree(structureOnly=true)` to locate specific components by pattern.

## inspect_component

Deep dive into a specific component — returns props, style, state (hooks), and optionally children.

```
inspect_component with name="ProductCard"
```

**Key parameters:**

- `childrenDepth` — control how deep nested children go

**Workflow:** Use after `get_screen_layout` or `find_components` to identify which component to inspect.

## inspect_at_point

Inspect layout AND props at (x, y). Returns FRAME PER ANCESTOR (position/size for every ancestor that hit-tested the point) plus the innermost component's PROPS (handlers as `[Function]`, refs, testID, custom props). Pure JS hit test via fiber tree + `measureInWindow` — no on-device overlay toggled, zero visual side effect.

```
inspect_at_point with x=150 y=300
```

Coordinates are in the shared screen space — feed it a point straight from `get_screen_state`, `get_screen_layout`, `measure`, or a screenshot summary. No conversion (see [Coordinates](#coordinates)).

Works on Paper, Fabric, and Bridgeless / new arch. Skips RN primitives and common library wrappers to surface meaningful components.

It also returns `source: {file, line, column}` — the absolute path and line where the component is rendered — plus the owner chain as `Source ancestors`. These are resolved from the fiber's `_debugStack` via Metro symbolication, so they work on React 19 where `_debugSource` was dropped, and `node_modules` frames are filtered out so you land on your own code. If Metro is unreachable the response carries `sourceUnavailable` and identity + props are still returned. Pass `source=false` to skip resolution in tight loops.

Style is the node's own style object, not RN's merged cascade — when a value looks wrong and isn't set on the node itself, walk the ancestors the tool returns.

**Best for:** identifying what renders a pixel, layout debugging ("where exactly is each ancestor positioned?"), props/handler inspection ("what fires when this Pressable is pressed?"), and rapid/repeated calls (no overlay flicker).

## get_images

Access the shared image buffer containing screenshots from all tools (`ios_screenshot`, `android_screenshot`, tap verification).

```
get_images
```

Returns metadata only by default. Use `id` or `groupId` + `frameIndex` to retrieve actual image data. Tap burst verification stores frame groups here when `burst=true` is used.

## Recommended Workflows

### Understand What's on Screen

1. `get_screen_state` — active route, overlays, and every element with a tap-ready centre
2. `get_screen_layout` — see all visible components with positions
3. `find_components(pattern="...")` — find specific components by name
4. `inspect_component(componentName="...")` — get full props, state, hooks for a component

### Identify a Component from a Screenshot

1. Take a screenshot (`ios_screenshot` / `android_screenshot`)
2. Estimate the target element's coordinates
3. `inspect_at_point(x, y)` — get the component, its ancestors, and the source file:line
4. Use the file path to find and edit the source code

### Debug Layout Issues

1. `get_screen_layout(extended=true)` — see positions and layout styles
2. `inspect_at_point(x, y)` — check frame measurements and props at a specific point
3. Compare actual frames against expected layout
